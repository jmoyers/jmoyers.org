There's a change happening in the industry that's related to all the tooling that has become available that has really sped up not only development, but ideation and really the entire software development lifecycle.

There are people in the industry and perhaps in your organization that have a lot of context. They have good judgment, they have reasonable design sense, they know a lot about your product, the market fit, the ideal customer profile. They understand the competitive landscapeâ€”who the different players are, what they're doing, where the opportunities lie. And on top of all that, they have the skills of a high-end software developer.

What has traditionally limited these individuals is that you can only focus on so much. The traditional way of writing software is extremely labor intensive. The number of lines of code on average has been going up substantially as the tools get better, as the industry gets more mature over time, but in general, we're talking between hundreds and on the outside, thousands of lines of code per week.

There are many arguments to keep this number relatively small. Everything from code quality and writing code that matters takes time to the fact that 70-75% of software development is maintenance cost over time. So writing kind of crap code really quickly generates a disproportionate amount of negative inertia in your product and in your company over time.

Prior to this change, the best way to scale your impact on the organization was to go down one of a few fairly well-defined tracks in software companies. One thing you could do is become a staff engineer and focus on driving technical change and technical direction through an entire engineering organization as it scales up. This is an extremely valuable skill. You have disproportionate impact beyond yourself that affects the development of hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of developers, depending on the scope of your contribution and the size of the company.

Another way is to focus on building teams and attracting the best talent and on systems design at the organizational level and on really good people management. This is another intensely multiplicative way to drive impact on your product and to build value in your business. Because as you build scalable structures and attract the best talent, you are in turn building better and better product that fits the market better. And as long as you are careful about your focus, you're going to be driving a tremendous amount of enterprise value over time. This is the traditional sort of VP Engineering, CTO style route.

However, companies take time to build. It takes time to grow revenue. In all but the most unicorn cases, let's say between 40 and 60% growth is deemed to be very high. And over time, over the course of years, you're building a very successful company that has $100M+ exit.

However, when you're doing this, you really have to be somewhat cautious of the cost constraints, right? So you're trying to keep your burn multiple low, so you can't just grow in an unbounded way unless you've created sort of like a hypergrowth frenzy style environment. And let's be honest, most startups are not that. They are solving a practical problem in a medium growth space and they can't just hire in an unlimited fashion.

So for this sort of messy middle style of organization where you're building sustainably, solving real problems in the real world, creating enterprise value, your team ends up being relatively constrained. Let's say between two and four teams of developers of between five and seven hands-on keyboard engineers. And that changes over time, but in a very incremental way, assuming you're not having some sort of B2C viral takeoff or you haven't cracked the code of hypergrowth.

What this means is the high context individual can only have impact insofar as they're allowed to grow within the cost constraints that they've established. So your total impact across your organization is limited by the total headcount and the problem you're trying to solve and the direction you're trying to go in.

So all of a sudden we have an interesting problem arising where somebody who's extremely high context, who maybe has the skills of a high-end IC, who hasn't left the technology behind, who can still code quite well, might even be a code machine archetype where they're able to put out a tremendous amount of code becomes uninhibited [[1]](#ref1) by how quickly they can type on the keyboard.

I'm talking about agentic processes like Claude Code [[2]](#ref2), like Cursor [[3]](#ref3), like our ever expanding arms race that's happening in the AI world, where we're very focused on software development and coding in particular. And so the tooling has just gotten so much more advanced than almost any other field.

Think of where we were a year ago compared to where we are now. We've gotten Claude Code, we've gotten Cursor 1.0 [[4]](#ref4), we've gotten MCP servers and the MCP protocol [[5]](#ref5), we've gotten agentic coding. It's no longer single one-shot chat interface style editing, but rather very extended multi-shot, think-time compute-driven, rule-building, sub-agentic processes that are building up this massive ability to multiply your own impact.

An individual can probably produce something on the order of ten thousand lines of new, highly structured, debugged, high quality (for lack of a better term) code, a day.

However, as the tools have been getting better over specifically the last two to three months, the ability to write code quickly has changed. So what this means is that these high context individuals in your organization have a different opportunity cost than they used to.

The practical problems really end up being how quickly you can ideate becomes one such problem, upstream of software development. Another problem is how quickly you can actually do QA processes that make sure that the code that you're developing services all the edge cases. The user interface is hardened. Your back-end processes are hardened. You have good security controls in place, and you're trying to do the standard penetration test style stuff.

It's relatively easy to set up sub-agents for writing unit tests and integration tests, but it's relatively difficult even now to write extensive Playwright tests that verify UI functionality. The main problem is that the tool use benchmarks plus the computer use benchmarks show that even the best models that have the best spatial awareness struggle with operating a UI very well. What this means is that the loop for doing UI verification is pretty slow. And even now, I still have to hybridize it with a lot of manual processes, walking through Playwright tests by hand. In general, I feel that that loop for writing end-to-end integration tests and verifying functionality is something that agents really still struggle with. I want to be clear, this is a temporary problem, though.

Actually having the organization that is the catcher's mitt for taking this 10,000 lines of code and vetting it appropriately is very difficult. Because it becomes very difficult for you to let go of code review, and you probably shouldn't at this point. There are a ton of errors that agentic coding makes, even when the practitioner that's in charge of it is piloting it well and doing their own code review. The sheer volume is very difficult to get your hands around.

Recently, I was watching an interview with Terence Tao, who's an Australian-American mathematician. He's a Fields Medal winner, and he's a professor of mathematics at UCLA. One of the things he was talking about is the concept of foxes and hedgehogs. Foxes are capable of looking at many topics and having a reasonably deep understanding, but absolutely they are not masters to the edge of every field that they're touching. They are masters of connective tissue. They're masters of taking concepts from one area and applying them in a new field. And this connective tissue is really important for forward progress. A hedgehog is somebody who can go extremely deep within a field or two, and you're kind of trading off between specialization and the ability to generalize. 

We absolutely need both types of individuals, right? We need to retain our ability as a human race to go to the edge of every field and deeply specialize and do research that's going to progress specific aspects of our ability to control this technology and push our understanding of the world and science forward. I do also feel that a very skilled fox now has the ability, at least within the domain of building software, building products, building new technologies that rely on connective tissue way faster than previous. And this ability to generalize and apply not just sort of ideation and vibe coding, but rather fairly deep understanding of each of the technology pillars they might be touching, but then do so with the business context, with the ability to communicate value with the aesthetic sense to understand what is good design with good user experience instincts. If you can combine those things, you really can, as an individual or with a very small team, push things forward way faster. Faster than before. So much faster that the opportunity cost needs to be measured differently.

I'm not exactly sure what the implications of all this are, just that we really need to pay attention to it. One conclusion I think that's pretty self-evident is that the ratios in the industry are going to change when it comes to the style of employee that makes up a good product pod over time. Previously, you might get away with a relatively small number of product managers and product designers or a hybrid thereof versus total developers. But I think at least in the face of the current tool maturity in software development versus those in design and product management, I think there's an argument to be made for more people examining what to build next, how to build it and how to build it well versus the total number of developers. Another option is that the employees that become the most valuable are hybrids thereof, where you have a pretty darn good sense of where the product needs to go and how it needs to look and feel and you're also capable of building the thing.

The danger is we get deluded in all professions and do things worse. The upshot is when you have hyper specialization, there's a ton of make work that starts to happen, especially as a product matures over time. There are careful lines to be walked here where you're not over-polishing a product pre-MVP. You're able to produce a good amount of software surface area while maintaining high quality. You're not allowing your organization to lose the spirit of making good, professional, delightful products that solve real problems.

Also it may not be clear, but Terence Tao considers himself a fox. In a way, this is pretty hilarious, since he's gone deeper than almost anyone else in the world in almost all fields of math, let alone the ones he specialized in. So, this is all by degrees in reality. I don't consider myself a vibe coder. I don't consider myself an executive that's removed from the actual process of making software. I consider myself somebody who, at a point in his career, went all the way down to the metal, including learning assembly language and how to unroll loops from compiled code and optimize for specific architectures, and then I've abstracted up and abstracted up and abstracted up over time and taken on management, gone back and forth between principal engineering and engineering management over the course of my career.

So, in a way, I think it's important to every once in a while become a hedgehog, go very deep in a particular area, even if it's not something you're professionally focused on, and get to the edge of a particular field. You may not be doing research, but if you're applying principles from something that's relatively brand new, you're understanding your craft really well, you're building something that's extremely high quality that you care about, sort of taking the Scale AI founder's advice, Andrew Wang, and saying something along the lines of the way to build products really well is to care, to simply care more than others. Another way to think about this is that you honestly spend 10 to 20 times the amount of time, maybe 100 times the amount of time, getting something correct, understanding something well. Getting a good intuition about it, building it, producing something, putting your hands on it, getting feedback about it, putting it out into the world, getting over your sort of the inertia that is difficult to overcome, sharing something when you're doing something for yourself or personally.

Something that I tell my direct reports a lot of the time is that it may seem like certain individuals in the space or in the industry or in the world in general seem to have instantaneous results that are extremely high quality. This is almost always complete nonsense. They're just spending 10 to 100 times more time behind the scenes, perfecting something, caring about something, thinking about something in the shower, kind of wrestling with the ideas. And then actually making things. And what you're seeing is the five-minute demo, the 10-minute demo, the 10-minute talk that comes from those hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of hours of experience.

So while I do think it's a good thing to be a fox in this era, where you're kind of focused on connective tissue, you have a lot of context, you're good at many things and can apply specific principles from many fields, I think it is really important to find a focus and go deep and to do that cyclically throughout your career so that you don't become completely disconnected from how to make, how to build things, how to understand things deeply. Because just being an idea person isn't going to cut it. I am able to build software fast because I understand how to make good software. I understand the cost of maintenance. I've been bitten by not invented here. I've been bitten by building something without getting customer feedback. I have the experience of going deep within a field, and then I can pull back and learn more about all the surrounding things so that it gives me the ability to kind of cross the traditional boundaries. I think the tools are just accelerating the capability of folks who can cross those boundaries.
