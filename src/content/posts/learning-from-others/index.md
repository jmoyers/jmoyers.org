Learning from the best people around you is one of the most underrated growth
strategies in business.

I recently came across insights about how companies scale revenue teams
effectively, and it got me thinking about the incredible learning opportunities
I've had this year at Encamp.

This resonates deeply with what I've been experiencing firsthand.

## Learning from Luke

Luke has been leading founder-led sales at Encamp, and watching him work has
been like getting a masterclass in authentic selling. He doesn't just pitch our
product - he genuinely understands our customers' pain points and builds real
relationships. There's something powerful about a founder who can articulate not
just what we do, but why we exist. His approach to discovery calls and his
ability to connect our mission to real business outcomes has taught me how much
storytelling matters in B2B sales.

## Learning from Jenny Vance

Our new CRO Jenny Vance has brought a level of professionalism to our revenue
organization that I've never seen before. The frameworks she's implementing
around forecasting accuracy, the discipline she's bringing to our sales process,
and her systematic approach to pipeline management - it's been eye-opening.
She's taking what Luke built and scaling it in ways that maintain the
authenticity while adding the rigor we need to grow.

## The guitar friend effect

This reminds me of a time in college when I made friends with someone down the
hall who was studying guitar at university. That year became my fastest musical
growth period in my entire life. Being around someone who was deeply committed
to their craft, watching their practice routine, hearing their thought process -
it was like drinking from the firehose.

That's exactly what working with Luke and Jenny feels like. I'm surrounded by
people who approach revenue with intentionality, creativity, and expertise that
I can absorb just by being present and asking good questions.

## Still learning

What keeps me grounded is knowing I still have so much to learn. Every customer
conversation reveals gaps in my understanding. Every forecast review shows me
new ways to think about our business. Every strategic discussion opens up
possibilities I hadn't considered.

I'm grateful to be in a position where I can learn from people who excel at
their craft. And I'm humbled by how much there is still to discover about
building and scaling a revenue organization.
