With the end of any big project or game changing release, there is a time
afterwards for necessary reflection. For Encamp, our Super Bowl is the reporting
season that starts in January and runs through March. Next year is a biennial
reporting year as well - our customer's obligations skyrocket in this period of
time, and we're here to help.

So, its time to prepare our team and technology for that expected growth - we've
seen a 61% increase in facilities on platform this year and we absolutely expect
that to continue.

Since March 1st, we've had a half dozen retrospectives between our Compliance
and Engineering teams. One of our main goals is to prioritize product and
tooling that will increase throughput, drive a reliable customer experience and
allow for our tiny and mighty team to double capacity.

I get extremely excited by this type of work. There are so many excellent ideas
in the organization, and it has to be a core leadership muscle to listen, help
to focus the conversation to prioritize by impact and cost and to incorporate
feedback from our customers.

Our post-season customer survey has a mind-blowing 198 respondents (thank you!)
and we're taking it to heart and building it into our roadmap and operations.
