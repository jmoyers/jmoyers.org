Hello friends!

Lets talk about chat. Its one of our most used channels and we’re going to be giving it some serious attention in the next few releases. Today, I am excited to give a preview of what’s coming in the very first release.

Keep in mind, I’m going to be showing a development version of our Mac client, and it will very likely change before release. And worry not, all these features will be in our Windows client at launch.

1.  **Collect all active conversations in one window.** We know what its like to have active conversations going with half your team, and we think its a pain to have to manage so many individual windows, too. We’ll provide you with one window that handily collects all these conversations and keeps track of when new messages arrive.

2.  **More consistent and beautiful type treatment.** Both room and peer-to-peer chat are getting this upgrade. It includes new spiffy timestamp separators and ‘tears’ for when you leave a room and come back, representing a gap in history. We’ve put a big focus on trying to make this easy on the eyes.

3.  **Cross-platform support for preformatted text.** Ever try and copy and paste a piece of code or other whitespace sensitive content into chat? We’re going to make this experience better by detecting this type of content, preserving the whitespace, and using monospaced font. Everything lines up again! All is right with the world.

4.  **Embed all the media!** We’ve already got embedded image support in our development client. Prepare yourself for an attack of gifs. Remember, we leave it up to make sure you don’t overload yourself with _too many_ gifs. We’ll see what else our devs can fit in — if you have any suggestions about embedded media types that are useful, let us know!

5.  **Unread and offline message support.** We’ll keep track of what you’ve seen and what you haven’t. We’ll badge the individuals and provide you with a nice consistent way to track when you receive new messages. Hurray for not missing messages!

6.  **A streaming API.** We’ll support Hubot and a javascript client library to start. Together, we can kick open the door to integrations! Check out this post for more details on the specifics.

So much good stuff. Still more to come. Whats top of mind for us after this? Group Chat and Search skyrocket to the top of the list. We’re also sorting through our Spring survey and collecting your feedback! Keep it coming in. Post a comment or find me directly on twitter @joshuamoyers.
