I enjoy building software that solve problems in the real world. I think a lot
about startups, the way in which we build software, and how to create an
environment where hungry/humble/smart people can thrive. I love design and user
experience and I care a lot about what I do. Outcome over process and output.

## CTO - Encamp

_2022 - present_

The end-to-end environmental compliance platform. I run product, engineering,
and compliance. Our product helps companies understand, managage and comply with
environmental regulations. We work on hard problems - integrating with 100+
government agencies, processing complex regulatory documents, and delivering
reports that keep emergency responders safe. We make sense of our customer's
environmental data and make it an asset rather than a risk.

The company has a mission that is important - make what's good for business good
for the environment. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to build systems
that scale and reliably connect to a vast surface area of third party government
agencies, how to keep our team productive, and how to push the boundaries of
what's possible with modern tooling.

I'm particularly interested in AI-native development workflows. I've been
experimenting with tools like Cursor, claude-4-opus, and building development
environments that let us move faster while maintaining quality. The goal is to
find the sweet spot where new technology amplifies human capability rather than
replacing it.

We use TypeScript, React, Node.js, Postgres, Apollo GraphQL, and a bunch of AWS
services. Everything is containerized, well-tested, and designed to handle the
complexity of regulatory compliance at scale.

### What I think about

How to hire the best people to build our product. The parts of software that
hold the most inertia - data model, public APIs (I'm a student of Will Larson).
Being a good mentor and boss while maintaining high standards for throughput.
Staying close to building the product - UX matters, our tools matter, our
process matters. Researching and building with the AI-native stack as frontier
models get better and better.

## Owner & Principal Engineer - OpenCourse.app

_2018 - 2022_

Built an open source education platform from scratch. The idea was to create
beautiful, intelligent study sessions with course-building tools and resource
discovery. I focused on offline-first architecture and mobile-friendly design
while keeping it compatible with basically every browser.

The whole thing was containerized and deployed with Docker Swarm. I used
Terraform for infrastructure and Ansible for provisioning. React PWA on the
frontend, GraphQL with Apollo for state management, Postgres for data, and a
bunch of observability tools to keep everything running smoothly.

## VP of Engineering - Sococo

_2011 - 2015_

Sococo was a virtual office platform - think of it as a persistent video chat
space for distributed teams. I ran a team of 20 engineers building clients for 5
platforms and managing 100+ servers handling millions of audio minutes per week.

The real challenge was making real-time audio and video work reliably across all
these different platforms. We had to solve for network conditions, codec
compatibility, and user experience on everything from iPhones to Windows
desktops.

During my time there we grew revenue and paid seats 4x.

## Fractional CTO / Founding Engineer

_2015 - 2022_

Worked with companies to build products the right way from the start. I focused
on automated testing, build automation, and sustainable development practices.
The goal was always to set teams up for long-term success rather than just
shipping something quickly.

## Mac & Web Technical Lead - Sococo

_2009 - 2011_

Started as the principal web developer, then moved over to build and launch the
Mac desktop client. Also built all of Sococo's internal tools for monitoring
customer deployments and tracking metrics.

## Director, Commercial Operations - IronRidge

_2004 - 2009_

Managed delivery of large commercial solar projects - everything from municipal
power plants to custom rooftop systems. I worked with the executive team on
strategy and managed a small team of engineers developing products in a
competitive industrial marketplace.

The work involved creating partnerships with vendors in China and the US,
handling contract negotiations, prototyping, and figuring out how to scale
manufacturing and delivery.
