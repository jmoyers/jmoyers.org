Just installed Ghost, so I can keep doing longer pieces of writing without having to use a third party publishing platform.

So far I'm enjoying the markdown editor and the install was not too bad.

Got this theme stock from: [https://github.com/johelaq/readable](https://github.com/johelaq/readable) -- only made a few tweaks based on taste, really. Haven't checked it out on mobile, but honestly I'm not too worried about it.

Used [https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) to set up some route forwarding. I still have my 'resume' posted as a static site generated and minified, served using express/connect static.

Overall, pretty nice and painless experience!
