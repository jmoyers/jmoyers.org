I've been learning x86(-64) assembly on both Mac and Windows.

I've been using the resources at
[Open Security Training](http://OpenSecurityTraining.info) as well as as the
[University of Washington Hardware/Software Interface](http://coursera.org/course/hwswinterface)
course.

My intent is to read two different selections on Windows and Mac OS internals as
well in a quest to get closer to the hardware.

One of the exercises was to disassemble memcpy and take a look at what its doing
down a particular branch. Found it interesting, so gist is below.

1.  If the size of the struct is under 32 bytes, it will do 4 byte copies using
    mov (source -> edx -> destination), then 1 byte copies (source -> al ->
    destination) if its not 4 byte aligned

2.  If the size >= 32 && size < 128 it does some fancy stuff with 64 bit
    registers (doesn't matter that project is x86 or that sse is explicitly
    turned off, i think because its linking to runtime libraries)

3.  If you mess with sizes above 128, it will use rep movs... some of the time
