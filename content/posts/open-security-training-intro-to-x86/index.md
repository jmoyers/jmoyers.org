I recently went through Open Security Training's Intro to x86 assembly
programming. Here is a quick review.

**Reference:** [Open Security Training
Website](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html) and [Youtube
Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL038BE01D3BAEFDB0)

In general, I thought this was a worthwhile course to go through, despite having
a pretty firm grasp on the material. I watched it at 2x speed and did do most of
the suggested exercises.

Its free and posted under Creative Commons, which is _extremely_ generous.

However, because it was a live class, there was definitely a fair amount of
'dead air' in between examples and when students were getting set up. The audio
and video quality are not particularly good, either.

I did start to take the intermediate x86 class, and I have to say its much worse
quality based on my individual learning style. They spend a ton of time on
topics which seem to be important
([GDT/LDT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Global_Descriptor_Table)
for one), but it lacked a lot of context as to why this is important to
understand, where it fits into the overall topic and how what is being
described is relevant. For instance, talking about how to parse a GDT on a
particular system, what particular offsets are for particular types of data
and so on. For me, this is the type of thing that should land in a reference
text until its time to get down to concrete examples of why something is
relevant.

I have since switched over to [Hardware Software
Interface](https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface) which is an
unmaintained University of Washington course. I am finding it to be more to my
style of learning without getting too bogged down in minutia. This is definitely
not going as deep as some of the OST.info materials, but I feel like I'm getting
a refresher and a roadmap for future deep dives.
