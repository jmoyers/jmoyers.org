Keeping it around, because I like the artwork and history :-)\\n\\n![Beep boop](http://i.imgur.com/oSLQzvt.png)\\n\\nWith the chat focused release, we added a long requested feature: the ability to integrate with Sococo. The integration comes in the form of a very simple chat API which will evolve over time, but will enable your team to experiment with adding business processes into your everyday Sococo activities.\\n\\nToday, the API allows:\\n\\n* Authenticating into a room\\n* Sending room chats\\n* Receiving room chats\\n\\nCombined with our new chat release which provides inline images, emoji, pre-formatted text, unread and offline message support, this provides a surprisingly powerful base for integrating third party tools into the product. We also know not every use case will be covered off by this first release. Group chat, for instance, which we will add support for in an upcoming release will add significantly to the number of use cases addressed by the API.\\n\\nIn addition to these building blocks, weâve open sourced a Hubot adapter for Sococo, which brings the power of the Hubot community library of integrations to Sococo. If you run a development team or manage a datacenter, you might check out ChatOps, a talk on using Hubot for automation in that space.\\n\\nIf youâre struggling for some ideas and think your team can benefit from some integration, next weâll cover off some ideas that might help you get started. The trick is to map key repetitive tasks into quick-to-issue commands, or turn something that is asynchronous into something that can happen in real-time.\\n\\n#### Development: Project Source Control & Bug Tracking\\n\\nA common setup is to have everyone whoâs on a project co-locate in a room. This could be a scrum team if youâre into Agile. Or just a set of folks working on loosely the same project.\\n\\nOut of the box, Hubot plugins for issue trackers are sort of useful. To really get at the core principles, we might need to write a little bit of custom glue code.\\n\\nLetâs identify some key areas:\\n\\n1) QA cycle time\\n\\n* Every day we move tickets from âOpenâ to âIn Devâ to âQAâ to âDoneâ\\n* The secret to a good burndown chart is real-time feedback!\\n* We can help: proactively notify the whole team about tickets changing status\\n* Provide a link to the ticket directly in chat and by convention, put a link to the build to test\\n* Have Hubot proactively poll your current sprint looking for tickets that are updated (or even blocked!) and put them into chat for the team on an interval\\n\\n2) What am I working on and has somebody mentioned me in a ticket?\\n\\n* Grabbing your own list of prioritized work for a sprint requires a bunch of steps: log in to VPN, enter your Jira credentials, bring up the appropriate sprint board, move tickets\\n* Replace that with a series of quick filters accessible from chatâ¦\\n * âhubot jira sprint meâ = all tickets in this sprint assigned to me, ordered by rank\\n * âhubot jira mentionsâ = all tickets that mention me in comments, ordered by date updated\\n * âhubot jira dev PS-1822â = start work on ticket PS-1822 and move it to âIn Devâ\\n\\n3) I broke the build or âhow do I get the latest build forâ¦?â\\n\\nLike many companies, when we write code it has to work on 5 platforms (literally) â Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, iPad. This means that occasionally somebody whoâs primarily working on Windows will break a Mac build and vice versa.\\n\\nWe also have a build server that does continuous integration. When somebody checks something in to source control, we can kick off builds for all platforms. We happen to use TeamCity which has a pretty extensive REST API. This lets us query running builds, builds with a particular status, link to artifacts for a particular project or branch, and so on.\\n\\nThe natural fit is to push builds which fail directly into room chat so the person can claim it to investigate and to let others know not to update their code on that platform until issues are resolved.\\n\\nThe second natural fit is to allow project managers and QA folks to quickly post links to the latest binaries available for a given project to facilitate baking the latest features.\\n\\n#### Customer Service: Monitoring Sign-ups or Requests for Help in Real-time\\n\\nLike many products, people sign up for Sococo off the web. We like to reach out to see if they have any questions about the product and to make our support staff available to everyone in real-time. Being that these are human beings, they are not checking their email for new sign-up notifications every minute.\\n\\nMinutes matter in an internet business. Peopleâs lives are busy and they donât have all day to devote to looking at new products and services. The good news: pushing real-time notifications to your support staff in chat is trivial â increasing the chance that you can reach out and delight your customer with human touch (with just a little bit of robot assistance).\\n\\nIf you use Salesforce or SugarCRM or some similar product, you can also look at integrating directly with those services.

Its about building a computer from nand gates in a hardware simulator, building an assembler, programming language and a kernel from first principles.\\n\\nSo far its been very interesting and informative - I've made it through to the third project in about 2 days or so of work. I posted this in their forums as a suggestions, but the only thing that caused a bit of churn for me was trying to remember much about boolean algebra -- this is the first principle behind taking a nand gate and progressively building up to an arithmetic logic unit in a CPU. They spend a bit more time of the tools they use (hardware description language, hardware simulator) than they do on deriving the implementation of the chips from the nand gate itself. This didn't stop me from completing the assignments, since after twisting and turning a bit its not much more than algebra and a few key \\\"ah ha\\\" moments. But, it does potentially stop someone who isn't familiar with computer science from picking things up, which I think should remain a goal.\\n\\nOne of the surprises, thinking about this, is how effective this teaching method could be for someone who wants to learn from the hardware up. This is not typically the way computer science is taught. All intros that I am aware of, as well as into later stages of learning are more about languages, data structures, algorithms and specifics of technologies (web apps, browsers, html, etc). I really do wish we took a more holistic approach to this learning process.\\n\\nThis is especially prevalent among self-learners, which are more and more common these days in the industry. We tend to ignore the inner workings of the machine in favor of building something tangible (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but then later in your career you may find yourself wanting of knowledge and not necessarily sure about the swiftest path to attaining it.

I dislike the Linux distro they have\nbased it on, and really don't like having a janky version of vim without my\ndotfiles. So I moved things to my OSX machine through manually rewriting the\nMakefiles. Its crappy, but it works\n[https://github.com/jmoyers/cool-parser/blob/master/Makefile].\n\nFor testing, I modified myparser  to do two new things\n[https://github.com/jmoyers/cool-parser/blob/master/myparser].\n\n * Start the lexer parser chain with GDB attached. This isn't very tricky, but\n   due to the use of pipes we have to create a temporary file.\n * Run the same test with the reflexer and refparser. This is very useful for\n   comparing your parse tree to the reference.\n\nUnfortunately the source isn't publicly available for the refparser/reflexer\n(for obvious no-cheaty-type reasons), but this means I could not do this once I\nmoved off the VM. So I periodically went back and checked if things were kosher.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf I had an infinite amount of time, I would definitely write unit tests for\nevery single grammar rule. As it stands now, this ad-hoc testing is only good\nenough for learning purposes, and not for any real world application. I wish the\ncourse provided a red/green unit test environment for developing this, or at\nminimum a series of test files that you should increasingly be able to parse. As\nit stands, you're left to your own devices with the language manual and the\nexample files directory (which isn't organized in any real systematic way with\nregards to implementation).\n\nMain
