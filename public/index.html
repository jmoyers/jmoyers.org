               Glue code is useless. Even if it seems trivial to write, it results in
               wasted time, more bugs, and a boring professional experience. Effective
               event-driven design can massively reduce cruft.
               </p>

               <p>
               Here I catalogue my observations on event implementations I've seen in C++, Cocoa/iOS, 
               the browser and Node.js over the past few months. I'd say my experience is heavily 
               colored by my successes with dynamic language event implementations and 
               I am still struggling with an effective C++ implementation.
               </p>

               <h3>Who's got the right idea?</h3>

               <p>
               The body of work out there that I prefer is largely based on well-known patterns like
               <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern'>observer</a> and 
               <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe'>pub/sub</a>.
               </p>

               <p>
               The good citizens I'd like to reference are as follows:
               <ul>
                  <li><a href='http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter'>EventEmitter</a> (Node.js)</li>
                  <li><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/Reference/Reference.html'>NSNotificationCenter</a> (iOS)</li>
                  <li><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener'>addEventListener</a> (Browser)</li>
               </ul>

               <p>
               They certainly aren't all perfect, especially the browser implementation with
               all its warts and cross-platform inconsistencies (this version is not properly
               supported in IE until version 9, for instance). However, every modern application
               framework for the browser has event support built on top of this mechanism, and as
               such a lot of people have spent a lot of time agonizing over smoothing it over.
               </p>

               <p>
               In Node, we have a push metaphor that uses strings to route with a typeless payload. 
               Here is a simple example to illustrate basic use. This won't blow your mind, but 
               this concept feeds into and evolves into better abstractions.
               </p>

               <pre><code>var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter,
      emitter = new EventEmitter();

   emitter.on('channel', function(event){
      console.log(event);
   });

   emitter.emit('channel', {
      name        : 'Event',
      description : 'An arbitrary hash of data in an object literal'
   });</code></pre>

               <p>
               This feels like a simple concept. Like, perhaps <em>too</em> simple.
               Strings as channel or route specifier? Well, it turns out you can do 
               some pretty fancy routing if you embrace strings. If you're interested,
               you can take a look at RabbitMQ
               <a href='http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html'>
               topic exchange examples</a> or 
               <a href='https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2'>hij1nx/EventEmitter2</a>.
               Regardless, you can get pretty far with no DSL related to routing at
               all. A plain string is expressive, it doesn't require a crufty type definition
               somewhere, and it can be stored in a hash for quick lookup. The only reasonable
               downside I've heard is that its succeptible to typos, and you get no compile 
               time errors. Okay, whatever.
               </p>

               <h3>Design considerations</h3>

               <p>
               There are a few key design principles which need to be observed to end up with something workable.
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Avoid the enormous switch statement, or <strong>keep it in context</strong></li>
                  <li>Avoid kitchen sink event classes, or <strong>give me only the data I need</strong>
                  <li>Avoid spinning up a thread and blocking on read loops, or <strong>embrace asynchronous push</strong></li>
                  <li>Avoid strongly typed channel/route specifiers, or <strong>keep your routing method generalized</strong></li>
                  <li>Think hard about using an event bus as a global shim, or <strong>scope your emitters with appropriate narrowness</strong></li>
               </ul>

               <p>
                  There are some ancilliary things that make a huge difference in practice. The biggest being this
                  is usually a hot code path, and therefore needs to be like, <em>fast</em>. There are lots of 
                  interesting issues when it comes to trying to preserve a strongly typed environment. I haven't
                  quite internalized all that just yet, but I have some pointers after having <a href='https://github.com/jmoyers/EventEmitter'>
                  explored a little bit</a>.
               </p>

               <h3>Keep it in context</h3>

               <p>
               I am not a fan of one big handler, or relying too much on hierarchical delegation.
               I should not have to go back to a source file that has absolutely nothing to do with
               the domain business logic to glue one layer to another. It makes for large, unwieldy
               files that are only loosely tied by logistics, not business or interface logic.
               </p>

               <p>
               In other words, big switch statements suck. Even where appropriate, I much prefer a function map
               or implicit delegation based on good routing logic. Here lies a place where bugs grow and deeply
               nested blocks flourish.
               </p>

   <pre><code>// A little C++ read loop
   while(ReadEvent(&event)){
      switch(event->type){
         case EVENT_TYPE_1:
            // unpack and dispatch
            break;
         case EVENT_TYPE_2:
            // unpack and dispatch
            break;
         case EVENT_TYPE_3:
            // some nested if statements, a loop, dispatch
            break;
         // and so on, to infinity
         }
      }
   }</pre></code>
               <p>
               The alternative is to build your state model such that it updates itself, or has a generic parent that
               handles that task. There are pitfalls here, depending on how you look at things. Some people prefer 
               to put as much logic into a model as possible -- Martin Fowler <a href='http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html'>
               bags on the Anemic Domain Model approach furiously</a>. Some prefer to keep the models as anemic as possible and push
               logic into a controller or view controller.
               </p>

               <p>
               My preference is to have a generic way for an object to keep track of its state. Assume your network 
               interface is an event emitter that will push data about your models on to specific channels, say with 
               a channel structure like: <pre></code>entity.id [or] user.92329D39-6F5C-4520-ABFC-AAB64544E172</code></pre>

               In this case, you can build some assumptions about the channel structure into your models and encapsulate
               interpreting the state coming off the wire within your model objects. You can also move this logic into an
               external construct, but I find it convenient that they update themselves.

   <pre><code>// The constructor for the User object. We pass the network interface in the 
   // constructor as a contrived example
   function User(network){
      // The attributes we're interested in tracking
      this.attributes = {
         first_name: "",
         last_name: "",
         email: ""
      };

      // Uniquely identify the model
      this.id = uuid();

      // Subscribe to events about this particular model
      network.on("user." + this.id, function(state){
         // And our model is in sync
         this.attributes = state;
      }.bind(this));
   }

   var user = new User(network);

   // Here an example of an event the network interface might fire. We get a state
   // update over the wire, and emit this as an event on the {entity.id} channel.
   // The objects listening for state updates on this entity will see this new data
   network.emit("user.92329D39-6F5C-4520-ABFC-AAB64544E172", {
      first_name: "Joshua",
      last_name: "Moyers",
      email: "jmoyers [at] gmail.com"
   });</code></pre>

               <h3>Give me only the data I need</h3>

               <p>
               This one is relatively simple, but it seems to happen on projects that grow organically over time, especially 
               in a typed language. You build a class or data structure that is used to propogate data through your event system.
               You end using the same bus for more than one type of data. And thus a baby kitchen sink class is born. You start using
               flags and accessors to deleniate usage. 
               </p>

               <p>
               If you find yourself building branching logic into event handlers, you are
               going down the wrong alley. Head it off at the pass with sufficiently narrow event emitters and data structures that
               have the data you need and no more. Think hard about whether you should put the state itself on the events, or provide 
               a pointer. I'm generally a fan of including the data itself on an event, rather than a pointer &mdash; this way one can
               reason about the threading model and not have to worry about locks. This data is <strong>mine</strong>!
               </p>

               <p>
               A good example is the evolution of <a href='http://socket.io'>socket.io</a>. Pre 0.7, you have exactly one channel over
               which you could send arbitrary json-encoded data. Many folks ended up building a shim to properly re-emit more specific events. 
               For example:
               </p>

   <pre><code>// Subscribe to the generic `message` event on the socket interface
   // We'll use this as a shim to re-emit the generic message on a more specific channel
   socket.on('message', function(data) {
      // Pull the event type off the object
      var type = data.type;

      // Delete the event type from the object
      delete data.type;

      // Re-emit the object on a channel specific to the event type
      socket.emit(type, data);
   });

   socket.on('more-specific-event', function(data){
       // Here we can build a more specific handler and keep
       // control logic and nested if statements related to 
       // event handling out of our application logic
   });</code></pre>

               <p>
               In a post 0.7 world, we have two things built into socket.io that helps you manage contextual complexity in your networking
               layer. They are custom events and first class channels. Custom events are simple, and you can see it in the first example on
               their home page:
               </p>

               <p style='font-weight: bold'>Custom Events, Server</p>
   <pre><code>var io = require('socket.io').listen(80);

   io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
     socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });
     socket.on('my other event', function (data) {
       console.log(data);
     });
   });</code></pre>

               <p style='font-weight: bold'>Custom Events, Client</p>
   <pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;/socket.io/socket.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     var socket = io.connect('http://localhost');
     socket.on('news', function (data) {
       console.log(data);
       socket.emit('my other event', { my: 'data' });
     });
   &lt;/script&gt;</pre></code>
               <p>
               In short, you can emit directly on the socket, and transparently it fires on the client side with event of the same name. This
               conveniently removes the need for the data event shim shown in my first example. This gets you further down the road of writing
               sufficiently specific event handlers.
               </p>

               <p>
               The second thing they provide is a <strong>namespace</strong> or channel. This makes the channel concept a first class citizen,
               and does so without having to open many websocket connections.
               </p>

               <p style='font-weight: bold;'>Namespaced Channels, Server</p>
   <pre><code>// Listen for websocket connections on port 80
   var io = require('socket.io').listen(80);

   // Namespace the chat object to the /chat route. Events specific to chat will
   // be fired over this channel, and you can hang more specific event handlers
   // off this object
   var chat = io
     .of('/chat')
     .on('connection', function (socket) {
       socket.emit('a message', {
           that: 'only'
         , '/chat': 'will get'
       });
       chat.emit('a message', {
           everyone: 'in'
         , '/chat': 'will get'
       });
     });

   // Same goes for this news object. This provides a way to effectively 
   // compartmentalize business logic
   var news = io
     .of('/news')
     .on('connection', function (socket) {
       socket.emit('item', { news: 'item' });
     });</pre></code>

               <p>
               As you can see, in this model, we are given two objects, chat and news, which are essentially there to provide a place to hang 
               business logic specific to those channels. If you keep a good domain driven design, these channels can be sufficiently specific
               such that you're able to write code only applicable to one part of the application at a time. This is quite nice from a context
               perspective, because you know very specifically that you're working on <em>just news</em> or <em>just chat</em>. It also makes
               things easier to read for those new to the code base &mdash; there are no complicated shims related to glue.
               </p>

               <h3>Embrace asynchronous push</h3>

               <p>
               I think its fair to say that your average networking program uses the OS thread model freely.  Threads are not inexpensive 
               (the default thread stack ranges from small to many megabytes). Some use threads more efficiently than others: they will 
               employ a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern'>Thread Pool</a> or some other resource management tactic. 
               Mostly, we are doing it because it is convenient. However, when you consider the relative problem: the internet is much, much, 
               <em>much</em> slower than RAM or local computation. You spend an enormous amount of time just sitting around waiting
               on the network. This doesn't mean the threads are actually <em>scheduled</em>, but as we know, locks, semaphores, and other 
               constructs to deal with multi-threaded data access are simply not fun to reason about and can lead to some of the most heinous 
               debugging sessions ever.
               </p>

               <p>
               Most platforms have a way for the OS to notify you that a file descriptors state has changed. 
               There's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_completion_port'>IOCP</a> on Windows, and select, kqueue, epoll on *nix 
               platforms. Node.js embraces these asynchronous API's, and with the help of libev (now wrapped in <a href='https://github.com/joyent/libuv'>
               libuv</a> for cross-platform compatibility) event loop, its able to maintain a low memory and thread footprint with tens of thousands of
               connections. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O'>NIO</a> does something similar for the JVM, and I believe the Jetty web server
               uses this tech under the covers.

               Mostly, it seems like a well design program using this model will employ the use of the smallest possible language construct that
               encapsulates a unit of work. This is often an anonymous function, block, or lambda. I enjoy programs that use this model because of
               their simplicity. Others will employ something larger, such as a named function, or even a class. I enjoy these less because they 
               encourage what in my opinion is unecessary structure. Consider this node program:

               <pre><code class='javascript'>var http = require('http');

   // Create a server and pass in the request handler function
   var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
      // You have a handle to the request and the response, both if which are evented
      // streams. You can listen for data events from the request if you need to
      // parse data incrementally from the client, for instance.
      //
      // For our purposes, we'll just immediately respond
      res.end('Hello world!');
   });

   // Listen on port 8080
   server.listen(8080);</code></pre>

               <p>
               This is your standard hello world gobbledy gook &mdash; however, you will notice a few things. First is the use of the anonymous function.
               You are passing a handler to this newly created http server in the form of the smallest language construct capable of encapsulating a behavior.
               Second is that there is no thread model present at this layer of code. You are not responsible for managing a thread pool, or spinning up a blocking
               read loop on another thread. Instead you can focus on the application logic. Under the hood, this is powered by an event loop in combination with
               your platforms asynchronous network api &mdash; the subject of another blog post altogether.

               <h3>Keep your routing method generalized</h3>

               <p>
               This concept seems to go against the hot code path note from above. Perhaps it does, but I'm not going to guess. I haven't seen someone point out an
               objective benchmark saying this is a bottleneck. I have embraced strings &mdash; some in the typed language world might call it inappropriate use of 
               `magic constants`. You know, you see somebody just arbitrarily add 10 to some variable. Why is it 10 and not 20? Is it padding, margin, correcting 
               an offset?</p>
               
               <p>However, strings are naturally pretty expressive and they also keep you from having to define arbitrary data structures such as enums or 
               class static const variables to categorize things. On the other hand, the compiler is not going to hold your hand and tell you you've made 
               a typo. Thats frustrating to some. I've learned to deal with that efficiently.
               </p>

               <p>
               One can also take things up a notch and define complicated routing logic. You can find this kind of thing in a topic exchange message queue,
               where you can subscribe to a group of channels by specifying a wildcard, such as 'user.*' &mdash; one can subscribe to updates about all users. This is also
               common in the web development world when specifying routes on an applciation server. Take <a href='expressjs.com'>Express</a> for example:
