    <h2>PRODUCT</h2>
    <p>
      My passion is building products to make life and work better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've spent many years writing code and wrangling technology to solve business problems. I've also had the pleasure of learning from and helping to direct <a href="https://twitter.com/hillarydesres">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mleacock">amazing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/designchops">designers</a> while building product at Sococo. My process has evolved to include a healthy dose of raw invention, pausing to make sure every pixel is absolutely necessary and easy to understand, and iterating quickly with customer feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      My background gives me the ability to understand the technology to its core, to get down to the business of writing code, and to effectively lead product development organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>ENGINEERING</h2>
    
    <p>
      I consider myself a "generalist" in the sense that I have many interests in computer science &mdash; however, I'm not the kind of guy to skim along the surface. I like to find the best techniques and mentors for a given technology and read every scrap of material I can find.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have an eye for detail which makes me a good front-end developer. I also enjoy working full stack, from database design, to fault tolerant cross platform C++, to real-time digital signal processing, to REST API design and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like to cultivate a collaborative, open environment where peers can tackle difficult and interesting design problems together. This starts with bringing the right people together &mdash; the process and tools used should serve the people and the product, not the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I'm building web applications with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> because the community is amazing and the technology is fun to work with.

           I am having a blast building product at Sococo. We've built an iPad and iPhone client (voice and screen share enabled), created a strong QA team, taken a data driven approach to product management decisions, revamped our messaging and product marketing, sped up and made our mission critical desktop clients and server infrastructure more reliable than ever.
