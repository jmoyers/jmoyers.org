   <h2>Modern Events</h2>
   
   <p>
   Glue code is useless. Even if it seems trivial to write, it results in
   wasted time, more bugs, and a boring professional experience. Effective
   event-driven design can massively reduce cruft.
   </p>

   <p>
   Here I catalogue my observations on event implementations I've seen in C++, Cocoa/iOS, 
   the browser and Node.js over the past few months. I'd say my experience is heavily 
   colored by my successes with dynamic language event implementations and 
   I am still struggling with an effective C++ implementation.
   </p>

   <h3>Who's got the right idea?</h3>

   <p>
   I prefer the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern'>observer</a> and 
   <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe'>pub/sub</a> patterns.
   </p>

   <p>
   A few good citizens:
   <ul>
      <li><a href='http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter'>EventEmitter</a> (Node.js on Back-end)</li>
      <li><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/Reference/Reference.html'>NSNotificationCenter</a> (iOS - Front-end)</li>
      <li><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html'>Key Value Observing</a> (iOS - Front-end)</li>
      <li><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener'>addEventListener</a> (Browser - Front-end)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
   They certainly aren't all perfect, especially the browser implementation with
   all its warts and cross-platform inconsistencies (this version is not properly
   supported in IE until version 9, for instance). However, every modern application
   framework for the browser has event support built on top of this mechanism, and as
   such a lot of people have spent a lot of time agonizing over smoothing it over.
   </p>

   <p>
   In Node, we have a push metaphor that uses strings to route with a typeless payload. 
   Here is a simple example to illustrate basic use. This won't blow your mind, but 
   this concept feeds into and evolves into better abstractions.
   </p>

   <pre><code>var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter,
emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('channel', function(event){
   console.log(event);
});

emitter.emit('channel', {
   name        : 'Event',
   description : 'An arbitrary hash of data in an object literal'
});</code></pre>

   <p>
   This feels like a simple concept. Like, perhaps <em>too</em> simple.
   Strings as channel or route specifier? Well, it turns out you can do 
   some pretty fancy routing if you embrace strings. If you're interested,
   you can take a look at RabbitMQ
   <a href='http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html'>
   topic exchange examples</a> or 
   <a href='https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2'>hij1nx/EventEmitter2</a>.
   Regardless, you can get pretty far with no DSL related to routing at
   all. A plain string is expressive, it doesn't require a crufty type definition
   somewhere, and it can be stored in a hash for quick lookup. The only reasonable
   downside I've heard is that its succeptible to typos, and you get no compile 
   time errors. Okay, whatever.
   </p>

   <h3>Design considerations</h3>

   <ul>
      <li>Avoid the enormous switch statement, or <strong>keep it in context</strong></li>
      <li>Avoid kitchen sink event classes, or <strong>give me only the data I need</strong>
      <li>Avoid spinning up a thread and blocking on read loops, or <strong>embrace asynchronous push</strong></li>
      <li>Avoid strongly typed channel/route specifiers, or <strong>keep your routing method generalized</strong></li>
   </ul>

   <p>
      There are some ancilliary things that make a huge difference in practice. Event can be a 
      a hot code path, especially in a server application, and therefore needs to be like, <em>fast</em>. 
      There are a lot of interesting practical issues around API in a strongly typed language, mostly
      around maintaining the right balance between type safety and complexity. I've done some exploring
      on an EventEmitter implementation in C++ <a href='http://github.com/jmoyers/EventEmitter'>here</a>.
   </p>

   <h3>Keep it in context</h3>

   <p>
   I am not a fan of one big handler, or relying too much on hierarchical delegation.
   I should not have to go back to a source file that has absolutely nothing to do with
   the domain business logic to glue one layer to another. It makes for large, unwieldy
   files that are only loosely tied by logistics, not business or interface logic.
   </p>

   <p>
   In other words, big switch statements suck. Even where appropriate, I much prefer a function map
   or implicit delegation based on good routing logic. Here lies a place where bugs grow and deeply
   nested blocks flourish.
   </p>

<pre><code>// A little C++ read loop
while(ReadEvent(&event)){
   switch(event->type){
      case EVENT_TYPE_1:
         // unpack and dispatch
         break;
      case EVENT_TYPE_2:
         // unpack and dispatch
         break;
      case EVENT_TYPE_3:
         // some nested if statements, a loop, dispatch
         break;
      // and so on, to infinity
      }
   }
}</pre></code>
   <p>
   The alternative is to build your state model such that it updates itself, or has a generic parent that
   handles that task. There are pitfalls here, depending on how you look at things. Some people prefer 
   to put as much logic into a model as possible -- Martin Fowler <a href='http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html'>
   bags on the Anemic Domain Model approach furiously</a>. Some prefer to keep the models as anemic as possible and push
   logic into a controller or view controller.
   </p>

   <p>
   My preference is to have a generic way for an object to keep track of its state. Assume your network 
   interface is an event emitter that will push data about your models on to specific channels, say with 
   a channel structure like: <pre></code>entity.id [or] user.92329D39-6F5C-4520-ABFC-AAB64544E172</code></pre>

   In this case, you can build some assumptions about the channel structure into your models and encapsulate
   interpreting the state coming off the wire within your model objects. You can also move this logic into an
   external construct, but I find it convenient that they update themselves.

<pre><code>// The constructor for the User object. We pass the network interface in the 
// constructor as a contrived example
function User(network){
   // The attributes we're interested in tracking
   this.attributes = {
      first_name: "",
      last_name: "",
      email: ""
   };

   // Uniquely identify the model
   this.id = uuid();

   // Subscribe to events about this particular model
   network.on("user." + this.id, function(state){
      // And our model is in sync
      this.attributes = state;
   }.bind(this));
}

var user = new User(network);

// Here an example of an event the network interface might fire. We get a state
// update over the wire, and emit this as an event on the {entity.id} channel.
// The objects listening for state updates on this entity will see this new data
network.emit("user.92329D39-6F5C-4520-ABFC-AAB64544E172", {
   first_name: "Joshua",
   last_name: "Moyers",
   email: "jmoyers [at] gmail.com"
});</code></pre>

   <h3>Give me only the data I need</h3>

   <p>
   If you find yourself building branching logic into event handlers, you are
   going down the wrong alley. Head it off at the pass with sufficiently narrow event emitters and data structures that
   have the data you need and no more.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   Think hard about whether you should put the state itself on the events, or provide 
   a pointer. I'm generally a fan of including the data itself on an event, rather than a pointer &mdash; this way one can
   reason about the threading model and not have to worry about locks. This data is <strong>mine</strong>!
   </p>

   <p>
   A good example is the evolution of <a href='http://socket.io'>socket.io</a>. Pre 0.7, you have exactly one channel over
   which you could send arbitrary json-encoded data. Many folks ended up building a shim to properly re-emit more specific events. 
   For example:
   </p>

<pre><code>// Subscribe to the generic `message` event on the socket interface
// We'll use this as a shim to re-emit the generic message on a more specific channel
socket.on('message', function(data) {
   // Pull the event type off the object
   var type = data.type;

   // Delete the event type from the object
   delete data.type;

   // Re-emit the object on a channel specific to the event type
   socket.emit(type, data);
});

socket.on('more-specific-event', function(data){
   // Here we can build a more specific handler and keep
   // control logic and nested if statements related to 
   // event handling out of our application logic
});</code></pre>

   <p>
   In a post 0.7 world, we have two things built into socket.io that helps you manage contextual complexity in your networking
   layer. They are custom events and first class channels. Custom events are simple, and you can see it in the first example on
   their home page:
   </p>

   <p style='font-weight: bold'>Custom Events, Server</p>
<pre><code>var io = require('socket.io').listen(80);

io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
   socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });
   socket.on('my other event', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
   });
});</code></pre>

   <p style='font-weight: bold'>Custom Events, Client</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;/socket.io/socket.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var socket = io.connect('http://localhost');
socket.on('news', function (data) {
   console.log(data);
   socket.emit('my other event', { my: 'data' });
});
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code>
   <p>
   In short, you can emit directly on the socket, and transparently it fires on the client side with event of the same name. This
   conveniently removes the need for the data event shim shown in my first example. This gets you further down the road of writing
   sufficiently specific event handlers.
   </p>

   <p>
   The second thing they provide is a <strong>namespace</strong> or channel. This makes the channel concept a first class citizen,
   and does so without having to open many websocket connections.
   </p>

   <p style='font-weight: bold;'>Namespaced Channels, Server</p>
<pre><code>// Listen for websocket connections on port 80
var io = require('socket.io').listen(80);

// Namespace the chat object to the /chat route. Events specific to chat will
// be fired over this channel, and you can hang more specific event handlers
// off this object
var chat = io
   .of('/chat')
   .on('connection', function (socket) {
      socket.emit('a message', {
         that: 'only'
       , '/chat': 'will get'
      });

      chat.emit('a message', {
         everyone: 'in'
       , '/chat': 'will get'
      });
   });

// Same goes for this news object. This provides a way to effectively 
// compartmentalize business logic
var news = io
   .of('/news')
   .on('connection', function (socket) {
      socket.emit('item', { news: 'item' });
   });</pre></code>

   <p>
   <ul>
      <li>No shims for subscribing to a more specific channel</li>
      <li>
      If you maintain good domain driven design, channels allow your code to be
      nicely specific to a given part of the business logic. You're working on
      <em>just chat</em>, or <em>just news</em>
   </ul>
   </p>

   <h3>Embrace asynchronous push</h3>

   <p>
   People use threads freely.  That is to say, it is convenient to spin up a thread when you need to attach to a blocking api,
   such as a socket or reading from disk. They are not exactly free. There is a default thread stack which is totally platform 
   dependent. Sometimes you have to reason about mutable shared memory &mdash; deadlocks, livelocks. I'm not saying you can't mitigate some of 
   these problems. Embracing share-nothing and immutable memory. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern'>Thread Pools</a> 
   or resource sharing tactics.
   </p>

   <p>
   However, for a large class of problems you are simply waiting &mdash; you are doing no active computation. You just want to be notified
   about a network event. Consider the following node program.
   </p>

   <pre><code class='javascript'>var http = require('http');

// Create a server and pass in the request handler function
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
   // SOMEONE HAS CONNECTED! YES, I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED!

   // You have a handle to the request and the response, both if which are evented
   // streams. You can listen for data events from the request if you need to
   // parse data incrementally from the client, or send data incrementally out
   // through the request

   // For our purposes, we'll just immediately respond
   res.end('Hello world!');
});

// Listen on port 8080
server.listen(8080);</code></pre>

   <ul>
      <li>We use the smallest language construct capable of encapsulating behavior as the listener, the function</li>
      <li>There is no thread model present at this level of the application. No read loop, no locks/mutexes or worry over shared data</li>
      <li>As described, here we are simply waiting on someone to connect, so that we may exhange some data with them.</li>
      <li>
         Under the hood this is powered by select, kqueue, epoll, or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_completion_port'>IOCP</a>
         and an event loop powered by <a href='https://github.com/joyent/libuv'>libuv</a>. Low memory and thread footprint.
      </li>
   </ul>

   There we go. I can focus on my application now and not reasoning about a deadlock, livelock, or how to manage a resource pool.
   As for the underlying technique, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O'>NIO</a> does something similar for the JVM. Erlang
   takes a slightly different and also effective approach with their process model.
   </p>

   <h3>Keep your routing method generalized</h3>

   <p>
   Maybe this seems like an inappropriate use of 'magic constants.' Perhaps you are worried about the compiler not catching typos.
   Bah to you! Come up with a similarly flexible non-crufty typed representation capable of deeply nested topic trees, and I'll give
   you a high five. Until then, I just don't make typos. No, but seriously, web developers are used to very quick run + debug cycles.
   Typos add no significant overhead to my workflow. I can't speak for everybody. 
   
   <p>
   Strings are naturally expressive and they also keep you from having to define arbitrary data structures such as enums or 
   class static const variables to categorize things.  One can also take things up a notch and define complicated routing 
   logic. You can find this kind of thing in a topic exchange message queue, where you can subscribe to a group of channels 
   by specifying a wildcard, such as 'user.*' &mdash; one can subscribe to updates about all users. This is also common in 
   the web development world when specifying routes on an applciation server. Take <a href='http://expressjs.com'>Express</a> for 
   example:
   </p>

   <pre><code>var express = require('express');
var app = express.createServer();

// String based routing in express takes the form app.get(routeString, handler)

app.get('/', function(req, res){
   res.end('Hello root!');
});

app.get('/lady', function(req, res){
   res.end('Hello lady!');
});

app.get('/man', function(req, res){
   res.end('Hello man!');
});

// The express routing DSL lets you introduced named parameters that will be
// parsed into the request object under `params`

app.get('/dude/:name', function(req, res){
   res.end('Hello dude named ' + req.params.name);
});

app.listen(8080);</pre></code>

   <p>
   This routing DSL goes quite deep. The Express home page show something like 
   15 - 25 examples which range from very simple static routes, to very complex 
   wildcard based logic. In web, you often express the content type as part of 
   these headers (a la .xml or .json) as an alternative to http headers. Its very flexible.
   </p>

   <p>
   Also, you don't have to trust the node dorks. Take a look around:
   <ul>
      <li><a href='https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra'>Sinatra</a> (Ruby via <a href='https://github.com/bmizerany'>Blake Mizerany</a>)</li>
      <li><a href='https://github.com/facebook/tornado'>Tornado</a> (Python via <a href='https://github.com/facebook'>FriendFeed/Facebook</a>)
      <li><a href='https://github.com/fabpot/Silex'>Silex</a> (PHP via <a href='https://github.com/fabpot'>Fabien Potencier</a>)</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
   There's tons more that could be said about how this same concept applies to the UI.
   However, I'll cut things short there. Hopefully there's enough to get your brain thinking
   about events as more of a scalpel than a hammer.
   </p>
