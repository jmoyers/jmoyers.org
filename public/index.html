    <h2>PRODUCT</h2>
    <p>
      My passion is building products to make life and work better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've spent many years writing code and wrangling technology to solve business problems. I've also had the pleasure of learning from <a href="https://twitter.com/hillarydesres">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mleacock">amazing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/designchops">designers</a> while building product at Sococo, and my way of thinking has been heavily influenced by them. Its healthy to pause and make sure every pixel is absolutely necessary and easy to understand. Embrace small releases. Iterate with customer feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>ENGINEERING</h2>
    
    <p>
      I have an eye for detail which makes me a good front-end developer. I enjoy working full stack, from database design, to fault tolerant cross platform C++, to real-time digital signal processing, to REST API design and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is also my philosophy when organizing teams &mdash; I think its better when ownership extends beyond artificial barriers to include "whole product." I think its effective to dive and surface, solving technology challenges with the right tools and making sure that we're laser focused on the right problems in the first place. Process and tools should serve the product, customer and builders, not the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I'm building web applications with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> because the community is amazing and the technology is fun to work with.

        <h3>VP, Engineering & Design &mdash; Sococo</h3>
        <div class="location">October 2011 – Present, Mountain View</div>

        <p>
          Sococo Team Space makes your remote teams feel local. Build connected, vibrant, and engaged distributed teams through our always-on, real-time communication environment.
        </p>
        <p>
           I am having a blast building product at Sococo. We've built an iPad and iPhone client (voice and screen share enabled), created a strong QA team, taken a data driven approach to product management decisions, revamped our messaging and product marketing, sped up and made our mission critical desktop clients and server infrastructure more reliable than ever.

          Served as the principal developer for web technologies, then transitioned over to build and launch the Mac desktop client. Other accomplishments include building all Sococo's internal tools for monitoring the health of our customer deployments, tracking top line metrics, and doing search engine marketing from ads to analytics.

            <p>We integrated <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">Google's WebRTC</a> into our native app for both video and screen share. We built a media infrastructure that can handle tons of simultaneous streams.</p>
