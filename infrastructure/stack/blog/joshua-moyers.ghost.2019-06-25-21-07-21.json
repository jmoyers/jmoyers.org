Keeping it around, because I like the artwork and history :-)\\n\\n![Beep boop](http://i.imgur.com/oSLQzvt.png)\\n\\nWith the chat focused release, we added a long requested feature: the ability to integrate with Sococo. The integration comes in the form of a very simple chat API which will evolve over time, but will enable your team to experiment with adding business processes into your everyday Sococo activities.\\n\\nToday, the API allows:\\n\\n* Authenticating into a room\\n* Sending room chats\\n* Receiving room chats\\n\\nCombined with our new chat release which provides inline images, emoji, pre-formatted text, unread and offline message support, this provides a surprisingly powerful base for integrating third party tools into the product. We also know not every use case will be covered off by this first release. Group chat, for instance, which we will add support for in an upcoming release will add significantly to the number of use cases addressed by the API.\\n\\nIn addition to these building blocks, we’ve open sourced a Hubot adapter for Sococo, which brings the power of the Hubot community library of integrations to Sococo. If you run a development team or manage a datacenter, you might check out ChatOps, a talk on using Hubot for automation in that space.\\n\\nIf you’re struggling for some ideas and think your team can benefit from some integration, next we’ll cover off some ideas that might help you get started. The trick is to map key repetitive tasks into quick-to-issue commands, or turn something that is asynchronous into something that can happen in real-time.\\n\\n#### Development: Project Source Control & Bug Tracking\\n\\nA common setup is to have everyone who’s on a project co-locate in a room. This could be a scrum team if you’re into Agile. Or just a set of folks working on loosely the same project.\\n\\nOut of the box, Hubot plugins for issue trackers are sort of useful. To really get at the core principles, we might need to write a little bit of custom glue code.\\n\\nLet’s identify some key areas:\\n\\n1) QA cycle time\\n\\n* Every day we move tickets from “Open” to “In Dev” to “QA” to “Done”\\n* The secret to a good burndown chart is real-time feedback!\\n* We can help: proactively notify the whole team about tickets changing status\\n* Provide a link to the ticket directly in chat and by convention, put a link to the build to test\\n* Have Hubot proactively poll your current sprint looking for tickets that are updated (or even blocked!) and put them into chat for the team on an interval\\n\\n2) What am I working on and has somebody mentioned me in a ticket?\\n\\n* Grabbing your own list of prioritized work for a sprint requires a bunch of steps: log in to VPN, enter your Jira credentials, bring up the appropriate sprint board, move tickets\\n* Replace that with a series of quick filters accessible from chat…\\n * “hubot jira sprint me” = all tickets in this sprint assigned to me, ordered by rank\\n * “hubot jira mentions” = all tickets that mention me in comments, ordered by date updated\\n * “hubot jira dev PS-1822” = start work on ticket PS-1822 and move it to “In Dev”\\n\\n3) I broke the build or “how do I get the latest build for…?”\\n\\nLike many companies, when we write code it has to work on 5 platforms (literally) — Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, iPad. This means that occasionally somebody who’s primarily working on Windows will break a Mac build and vice versa.\\n\\nWe also have a build server that does continuous integration. When somebody checks something in to source control, we can kick off builds for all platforms. We happen to use TeamCity which has a pretty extensive REST API. This lets us query running builds, builds with a particular status, link to artifacts for a particular project or branch, and so on.\\n\\nThe natural fit is to push builds which fail directly into room chat so the person can claim it to investigate and to let others know not to update their code on that platform until issues are resolved.\\n\\nThe second natural fit is to allow project managers and QA folks to quickly post links to the latest binaries available for a given project to facilitate baking the latest features.\\n\\n#### Customer Service: Monitoring Sign-ups or Requests for Help in Real-time\\n\\nLike many products, people sign up for Sococo off the web. We like to reach out to see if they have any questions about the product and to make our support staff available to everyone in real-time. Being that these are human beings, they are not checking their email for new sign-up notifications every minute.\\n\\nMinutes matter in an internet business. People’s lives are busy and they don’t have all day to devote to looking at new products and services. The good news: pushing real-time notifications to your support staff in chat is trivial – increasing the chance that you can reach out and delight your customer with human touch (with just a little bit of robot assistance).\\n\\nIf you use Salesforce or SugarCRM or some similar product, you can also look at integrating directly with those services. Push the link to the new account record into the chat message that you send to your support reps. For us, we’ll also integrate links to our internal analytics platform for an account.\\n\\n#### DevOps: Integrating Monitoring Tools for Your Datacenter\\n\\nInternally, we use a variety of tools to monitor the service.\\n\\nThese are things like…\\nGraphite (Hubot script) – Graph performance data over time\\n\\nNagios/ZenOSS/PagerDuty (Hubot script) – Monitoring and issue tracking\\n\\nLogstash – Centralized logging infrastructure\\n\\nYou need a way to keep everyone on the same page when it comes to a time sensitive performance or service-level problems. Being able to quickly ask Hubot to provide a list of the services that have exceptions along with being able to interrogate Graphite for a graph of the component in question are important (e.g. hubot graphite medianode3.streamCount will post an image directly into chat with data over time, for everyone in the room to see).\\n\\nFurther, being able to share that real-time with your colleagues via inline images support in room chat is pretty key. You’re sharing data with them passively just by being in the same room in Sococo. You can talk about the steps that you’re going through live as you issue requests in chat, allowing everyone present to see the same data. This also allows you divide and conquer for multiple areas of investigation.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nTo reiterate, try to think of areas where there are repetitive or asynchronous tasks that can be made into shared real-time experience.

It would be really nice to have an appendix or optional path that focuses on an overview of the most current forms of these technologies and how they have optimized things over time. They only spend a few moments on these questions (basically a random question from the 'audience' at the end of each section). You have to simplify and focus on the end goal if you're to complete something like this in a matter of weeks.

Its\nabout building a computer from nand gates in a hardware simulator, building an\nassembler, programming language and a kernel from first principles.\n\nSo far its been very interesting and informative - I've made it through to the\nthird project in about 2 days or so of work. I posted this in their forums as a\nsuggestions, but the only thing that caused a bit of churn for me was trying to\nremember much about boolean algebra -- this is the first principle behind taking\na nand gate and progressively building up to an arithmetic logic unit in a CPU.\nThey spend a bit more time of the tools they use (hardware description language,\nhardware simulator) than they do on deriving the implementation of the chips\nfrom the nand gate itself. This didn't stop me from completing the assignments,\nsince after twisting and turning a bit its not much more than algebra and a few\nkey \"ah ha\" moments. But, it does potentially stop someone who isn't familiar\nwith computer science from picking things up, which I think should remain a\ngoal.\n\nOne of the surprises, thinking about this, is how effective this teaching method\ncould be for someone who wants to learn from the hardware up. This is not\ntypically the way computer science is taught.

It generates a valid c source file for the lexical rules you put together. The `.flex` file format is basically a c file with some special syntax.\\n\\nThe bulk of this assignment was hunting for implementation details. I do not enjoy courses as much when they don't go through an assignment pre-amble in the actual lectures. Feels bad to be hunting through pdfs. Yes, yes, RTFM and all that -- I just feel that education should be optimized for speed of intake, not to \\\"teach you how to hunt for stuff.\\\" Thats a valuable lesson I already learned literally 20 years ago. We're in a new age here.\\n\\n###Gotchas\\n* `make lexer`, not just `make` - I spent 20 minutes wondering if my changes to the base `cool.flex` were actually taking effect\\n\\n* A nice [base case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)) for the flex file\\n\\n* Pre-defined return types in a magic header not in your assignment folder (`/usr/class/cs143/include/PA2/cool-parse.h`)\\n\\n* You can nest rules via [`%x`](http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/Start-Conditions.html) directive -- directly applicable to string literal and comment parsing\\n\\n* The actual lexeme is in a global variable called `yytext` which is a null terminated c-string\\n\\n* When a lexeme is semantically relevant, you are expected to provide it to the parser by copying it into `cool_yylval` (which is a union, relevant members being `error_msg` and `symbol`)\\n\\n* They expect you to not just copy the string, but use 2 different global variables `inttable`, `stringtable` which implement a custom `StringTable` class. These are definied in `stringtable.cc` and the only relevant method is `char* add_string(char *)`.\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nRight up front, I will tell you `test.cl` has some minor syntax errors in it. Your parser should be able to handle them. You don't have to do anything thats particularly special for it to do so.\\n\\nThe output of running `./lexer`, with no rules defined, is just the entire output file. This makes it overwhelming to try to parse their supplied `test.cl`. Start with an extremely simple file containing just `=>`, on a line by itself. This is the only rule they provide. \\n\\nThe output should be:\\n```\\n#name \\\"your_file.cl\\\"\\n#1 DARROW\\n```\\n\\nThe anatomy is the `#name` preamble, which is just the file, followed by `#{line number} {lexeme class} {lexeme if applicable}`.

This means that two grammar rules you've added overlap (usually one is shorter than the other, so there is a choice as to whether the parser should go with the shorter or longer match).
