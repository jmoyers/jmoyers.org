# Project-specific Cursor Rules

## Always Use Project CLI Commands

- NEVER use raw `terraform` commands directly
- ALWAYS use `yarn cli terraform [args...]` instead of `terraform apply`
- ALWAYS use `yarn cli deploy-infra` to deploy AWS infrastructure
- ALWAYS use `yarn cli update-env` to get terraform outputs
- ALWAYS use `yarn cli deploy` for website deployments
- Use `yarn cli status` to check current project status
- Use `yarn cli config` to list all configurable variables
- The CLI handles AWS profile, region, and environment variables properly from
  `.env.local`
- **NEVER run `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, `yarn cli deploy-infra`,
  or any destructive commands** - the user will run these manually
- **NEVER edit the `.env.local` file** - it's protected and user-managed
- **ALWAYS disable AWS CLI pager** - use `--no-cli-pager` flag or `AWS_PAGER=""`
  to prevent output issues

## Infrastructure Management

- This project uses AWS infrastructure with Terraform
- Environment variables are managed through `.env.local` file
- DNS can be managed through Route53 or external providers like Namecheap
- SSL certificates are handled through AWS Certificate Manager with DNS
  validation
- The CLI automatically updates `.env.local` after successful terraform
  operations
