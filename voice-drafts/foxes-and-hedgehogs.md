# Voice Transcript

in src/content/posts/foxes/ i want to write a new post. here is a voice transcript that I'd like to turn into a post. I want to make an observation about a change in the industry that's related to all the tooling that has become available that has really sped up not only development, but ideation and really the entire software development lifecycle. There are people in the industry and perhaps in your organization that have a lot of context. They have good judgment, they have reasonable design sense, they know a lot about your product, the market fit, the ideal customer profile, the different players in the space. In terms of what the competitive situation is, and they have the skills potentially of a high-end software developer. What is l traditionally limited individuals is that you can only focus on so much and, you know, i th the traditional way of writing software is extremely labor intensive. You know, the number of lines of code on average, I'd say it's probably fair to say, has been going up substantially as the tools get better, as the industry gets more mature. Over time, but in general, we're talking between hundreds and on the outside, thousands of lines of code per week. There are many, many arguments to keep this number relatively small. Everything from code quality and writing code that matters takes time to the fact that seventy, seventy five percent of software development is Maintenance cost over time. So, writing kind of crap code really quickly generates a disproportionate amount of negative inertia in your product and in your company over time. However, as the tools have been getting better over specifically the last two to three months, the ability to write code quickly has changed. So what this means is that these high context individuals in your organization have a different opportunity cost than they used to. Prior to this, the best way to scale your impact on the organization was to do a variety of things. One thing you could do is become a staff engineer and focus on sort of driving. technical change and technical direction through an entire engineering organization as it scales up. This is an extremely valuable skill. You have disproportionate impact beyond yourself that affects the development of hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands developers, depending on the scope of your contribution and the size of the company. Another way is to focus on building teams and attracting the best talent and on systems design at the organizational level and on really good people management. This is another intensely multiplicative way to drive impact on your product and to build value in your business. Because as you build scalable structures, and attract the best talent, you are in turn building better and better product that fits the market better. And as long as you are careful about your focus, you're going to be driving a tremendous amount of enterprise value over time. This is the traditional sort of VP engineering kind of CTO style route. However, companies take time to build. It takes time to grow revenue. In all but the most unicorn cases, let's say between forty 40 and 60% growth is deemed to be very high. And over time, over the course of years, you're building a very successful company that has $100 million plus. Exit. However, when you're doing this, you really have to be somewhat cautious of the cost constraints, right? So you're trying to keep your burn multiple low, so you can't just grow. in an unbounded way unless you've created sort of like a hypergrowth frenzy style environment. And let's be honest, most startups are not that. They are solving a practical problem in a medium growth space and they can't just hire In an unlimited fashion, right? So for this sort of messy middle style of organization where you're building sustainably, solving real problems in the real world, creating enterprise value, your team ends up being, you know, relatively constrained. Let's say, you know, between two and four teams of developers of between five and seven sort of hands-on keyboard engineers. And that changes over time, but in a very Incremental way, assuming you're not having some sort of B2C viral takeoff or you haven't sort of cracked the code of hypergrowth. What this means is the high context individual can only have impact insofar as they're kind of allowed to grow within the cost constraints that they've established. So your total impact across your organization is limited by the total headcount and the problem you're trying to solve, right, and the direction you're trying to go in. So all of a sudden we have an interesting problem arising where somebody who's extremely high context, who maybe has the skills of a high end I C, who hasn't sort of left the technology behind, who can still code quite well, might even be a code machine archetype where they're able to put out a tremendous amount of code becomes uninhibited by how quickly they can type on the keyboard. So, I'm talking about agentic processes like clawed code, like cursor, like our ever sort of expanding race, this arms race that's happening in the AI world, where we're very Focused on software development and coding in particular. And so the tooling has just gotten so much more advanced than almost any other field. So, think of where we were a year ago compared to where we are now. We've gotten clawed code, we've gotten cursor 1.0, we've gotten MCP servers and the MCP protocol, we've gotten sort of AG. Agentic coding. It's no longer single one-shot chat interface style editing, but rather very extended multi-shot, think-time compute-driven, rule-building, sub-agentic process. Processes that are building up this massive ability to multiply your own impact. So there are lots of actual practical problems with this, but the idea is that an individual can probably produce something on the order of ten thousand lines of new, highly structured, debugged kind of High quality, for lack of a better term, code, a day. And the practical problems really end up being how quickly you can ideate is one such problem. Upstream of software development. Another problem is how quickly you can actually do QA processes that make sure that the code that you're developing services all the edge cases. The user interface is hardened. Your sort of back-end process. Are hardened. You have good security controls in place, and you're kind of trying to do the standard penetration test style stuff. So, actually, having sort of the organization that is the catcher's mitt for taking this $10,000. Lines of code and vetting it appropriately is very difficult, right? Because it becomes very difficult for you to let go of code review, and you probably shouldn't at this point. There are a ton of errors that agentic coding makes, even when the practitioner that's in charge of it is piloting it well and doing their own code review. The sheer volume is very difficult to kind of like Get your hands around.

Recently, I was watching an interview with Terrence Tao, who's an Australian-American mathematician. He's a Fields Medalist winner, and he's a professor of mathematics at UCLA. Things he was talking about is the concept of foxes and hedgehogs. Foxes are capable of looking at many topics and having a reasonably deep understanding, but absolutely they are not masters to the edge of every field that they're touching. They are masters of connective tissue. They're masters of taking concepts from one area and applying them in a new field. And this connective tissue is really important for forward progress. A hedgehog is somebody who can go extremely deep within, you know, a field or two, and you're kind of trading off between specialization and the the ability to generalize. We absolutely need both types of individuals, right? We need we need to retain our ability as a human race to go to the edge of every field and deeply specialize and do research that's going to progress specific aspects of our ability to control this technology and push our understanding of the world and science forward. I do also feel that a very skilled Fox now has the ability, at least within the domain of building software, building, you know, products building new technologies that rely on connective tissue way faster than previous. And this ability to generalize and apply not just sort of Ideation and vibe coding, but rather fairly deep understanding of each of the technology pillars they might be touching, but then do so with the business context, with the ability to communicate value with the Aesthetic sense to understand what is good design with good user experience instincts. If you can combine those things, you really can, as an individual or with a very small team, push things forward way faster. Faster than before. So much faster that the opportunity cost needs to be measured differently.

I'm not exactly sure what the implications of all this are, just that we really need to pay attention to it. One conclusion I think that's pretty self-evident is that the ratios in the industry are going to change when it comes to the style of employee that makes up a good product. Pod over time. Previously, you might get away with a relatively small number of product managers and product designers or a hybrid thereof versus total developers. But I think at least in the face of the current tool maturity in software development versus those in design and product management, I think there's an argument to be made for more people examining what to build next, how to build it and how to build it well versus the total number of developers. Another option is that the employees that become the most valuable are hybrids thereof, where you have a a pretty darn good sense of where the product needs to go and how it needs to look and feel and you're also capable of building the thing The danger is we get diluted in all professions and do things worse. The upshot is when you have over-specialization in an organization over time, there's a ton of make work. And I really think make work needs to be in quotes here that starts to happen. Especially as the product matures. An example is you might see a very successful product like Netflix change very, very little over time. And yet we have tens of thousands of people working on problems That never see the light of day. We're A-B testing 0.5% changes, and maybe something like 2% of the changes over time get into the product. They're trying to preserve value rather than to innovate and to push a frontier forward. In a startup, you're much more of a spear tip that's pushing the product forward by large multiples every time you create something new. And they're two different, very, very different muscles. And I find that, you know, especially in startups, this Fox metaphor is super important because those people are going to have a ton of agency to make to create a lot of value much more quickly than before. 

There are multiple careful lines to be walked here. You need to produce a good amount of software surface area while maintaining high quality. You can't allow your organization to lose the spirit of making good, professional, delightful products that solve real problems.

Also it may not be clear, but Terence Tao considers himself a fox. In a way, this is pretty hilarious, since he's gone deeper than almost anyone else in the world in almost all fields of math, let alone the ones he specialized in. So, this is all by degrees in reality. I don't consider myself a vibe coder. I don't consider myself an executive that's removed from the actual process of. Making software. I consider myself somebody who, at a point in his career, went all the way down to the metal, including learning assembly language and how to unroll loops from compiled code and optimize for specific. Architectures, and then I've abstracted up and abstracted up and abstracted up over time and take on management, gone back and forth between principal engineering and engineering management over the course of my career. 

So I guess what I'm advocating for is to spend time being both archetypes, hedgehogs and foxes. And to kind of treat this as sort of zooming in and zooming out and being able to mode switch quickly makes you a better communicator, makes you a better thinker. It helps you connect dots. in the sense that like lateral thinking becomes more of a second nature to you over time. And then let's transition to especially the importance early on in your career of going as deep as you possibly can so that you attain mastery. even if it's not something you're professionally focused on, to get to the edge of that field. For one thing, this positively impacts your imposter syndrome. And for another, it gives you this sort of credibility, not just in others judging you, but in you judging yourself. Yourself to know that you're not blowing smoke up your own ass.

Another way to think about this is that you honestly spend 10 to 20 times the amount of time, maybe 100 times the amount of time, getting something correct, understanding something well. Getting a good intuition about it, building it, producing something, putting your hands on it, getting feedback about it, putting it out into the world, getting over your sort of the inertia that is difficult to overcome, sharing something. When you're doing something for yourself or personally. This is essentially Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang's philosophy—that the way to build products really well is to care more than others. He only hires people who care more than others. It's invisible work, but it's what separates great from good.

Something that I tell my direct reports a lot of the time is that it may seem like certain individuals in in the space or in the industry or in the world in general seem to have instantaneous Results that are extremely high quality This is almost always complete nonsense. They're just spending 10 to 100 times more time behind the scenes, perfecting something, caring about something, thinking about something in the shower, kind of wrestling with the ideas. And then actually making things. And what you're seeing is the five-minute demo, the 10-minute demo, the 10-minute talk that comes from those hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of hours of experience. 

We're in an exciting era. I'm feeling like I'm able to continuously evolve week over week, and it feels like a lot of powerful and engaging personal growth comes from that. I'm looking forward to the next little while.
