We won! Because March 1st is arguably the most focused on deadline in the
environmental space, I want to take a minute to celebrate our team and our
customers today.

Over the last 60 days, the Encamp team:

- Completed regulatory activities for around 33k facilities on platform
- Automated over $1.5M in fees (thousands upon thousands of payments)
- Sent 31k email/snail mails to over 33k agencies across the United States
- All in all, its about 181k individual regulatory activities! ðŸ˜±

I'm absolutely blown away by our team and the technology. We're very grateful to
partner with our customers, state agencies, the EPA, and UT Dallas (who helps
quite a few states with tech) - all coming together to keep communities and
first responders safe.

Looking forward to the rest of 2025! ðŸš€
