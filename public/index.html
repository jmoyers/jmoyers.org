    <p>
      I enjoy building products to make life and work better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a student of user-first, design-centric product development. Every pixel counts. I've learned how hard and necessary it is to pull things out. Tools and process should never be self-serving. Always focus on the output and the challenge you set out to solve.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I'm building web applications with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, playing music, and riding bike in Oakland.
