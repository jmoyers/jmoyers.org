    <h2>PRODUCT</h2>
    <p>
      My passion is building products to make life and work better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've spent many years writing code and wrangling technology to solve business problems. I've also had the pleasure of learning from and helping to direct <a href="https://twitter.com/hillarydesres">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mleacock">amazing</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/designchops">designers</a> while building product at Sococo. My process has evolved to include a healthy dose of raw invention, pausing to make sure every pixel is absolutely necessary and easy to understand, and iterating quickly with customer feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      My background gives me the ability to understand the technology to its core, to get down to the business of writing code, and to effectively lead product development organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>ENGINEERING</h2>
    
    <p>
      I consider myself a "generalist" in the sense that I have many interests in computer science &mdash; however, I'm not the kind of guy to skim along the surface. I like to find the best techniques and mentors for a given technology and read every scrap of material I can find.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have an eye for detail which makes me a good front-end developer. I also enjoy working full stack, from database design, to fault tolerant cross platform C++, to real-time digital signal processing, to REST API design and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like to cultivate a collaborative, open environment where peers can tackle difficult and interesting design problems together. This starts with bringing the right people together &mdash; the process and tools used should serve the people and the product, not the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I'm building web applications with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> because the community is amazing and the technology is fun to work with.

           I am having a blast building product at Sococo. Over 6 months, we've built an iPad and iPhone client (voice and screen share enabled), created a strong QA team, taken a data driven approach to product management decisions, revamped our messaging and product marketing, sped up and made our mission critical desktop clients and server infrastructure more reliable than ever.

          I was responsible for management and delivery of our largest commercial projects, ranging from municipal power plants to large custom built rooftop systems.

This included everything from contract negotiations and prototyping to ascalable manufacturing and delivery of our products.
