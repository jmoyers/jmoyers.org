For the first time in probably 10 years, I've got a handle on my email. I
unsubscribed from every list I could find, created a set of auto filters that
apply a label and skip inbox based on some lists that I still want to be
subscribed to, but that I don't look at every day.

I feel much less stressed about my communications. It had grown and grown over
the years organically (both from managing 30+ people) and having interests in a
ton of different topics.

One thing I won't ever do again: subscribe to any mailing list on google groups.
I almost never actively participate in them, and the amount of goofy noise you
get is out of control.
